### Music Streams Prediction Model & Calculator

This project analyzes Spotify and YouTube data to predict song popularity using a regression model. With over 20,000 records and 27 features, I identified key drivers like comments, acoustic attributes, and optimal duration through feature selection methods such as Boruta SHAP and VIF. The model incorporates interaction and non-linear terms to reveal nuanced relationships between musical features and engagement. Insights from this project support data-driven strategies for production, marketing, and playlist curation, empowering stakeholders to optimize audience engagement and streaming success.
